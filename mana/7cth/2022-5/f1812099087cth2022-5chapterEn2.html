The subject of Song of Songs, a poem, is the history of love in an excellent marriage, revealing the progressive experience of an individual believer's loving fellowship with Christ for the preparation of His bride in six major stages: </p> <p class="CC2" onclick="show(this)">A. In the first stage of Song of Songs, the lover of Christ is drawn to pursue Him for satisfaction (1:2—2:7); the Lord wants His seeker to have a personal, affectionate, private, and spiritual relationship with Him: </p><div class="title"><p class="CC100">S.S. 1:2 Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth! / For your love is better than wine. </p> <p class="CC100">S.S. 1:3 Your anointing oils have a pleasant fragrance; / Your name is like ointment poured forth; / Therefore the virgins love you. </p> <p class="CC100">S.S. 1:4 Draw me; we will run after you—The king has brought me into his chambers—/ We will be glad and rejoice in you; / We will extol your love more than wine. / Rightly do they love you. </p> <p class="CC100">S.S. 1:5 I am black but lovely, O daughters of Jerusalem, / Like the tents of Kedar, like the curtains of Solomon. </p> <p class="CC100">S.S. 1:6 Do not look at me, because I am black, / Because the sun has scorched me. / My mother's sons were angry with me; / They made me keeper of the vineyards, / But my own vineyard I have not kept. </p> <p class="CC100">S.S. 1:7 Tell me, you whom my soul loves, Where do you pasture your flock? / Where do you make it lie down at noon? / For why should I be like one who is veiled / Beside the flocks of your companions? </p> <p class="CC100">S.S. 1:8 If you yourself do not know, / You fairest among women, / Go forth on the footsteps of the flock, / And pasture your young goats / By the shepherds' tents. </p> <p class="CC100">S.S. 1:9 I compare you, my love, / To a mare among Pharaoh's chariots. </p> <p class="CC100">S.S. 1:10 Your cheeks are lovely with plaits of ornaments, / Your neck with strings of jewels. </p> <p class="CC100">S.S. 1:11 We will make you plaits of gold / With studs of silver. </p> <p class="CC100">S.S. 1:12 While the king was at his table, / My spikenard gave forth its fragrance. </p> <p class="CC100">S.S. 1:13 My beloved is to me a bundle of myrrh / That lies at night between my breasts. </p> <p class="CC100">S.S. 1:14 My beloved is to me a cluster of henna flowers / In the vineyards of En-gedi. </p> <p class="CC100">S.S. 1:15 Oh, you are beautiful, my love! / Oh, you are beautiful! Your eyes are like doves. </p> <p class="CC100">S.S. 1:16 Oh, you are beautiful, my beloved; indeed, pleasant! Indeed, our couch is green. </p> <p class="CC100">S.S. 1:17 The beams of our house are cedars; / Our rafters are cypresses. </p> <p class="CC100">S.S. 2:1 I am a rose of Sharon, / A lily of the valleys. </p> <p class="CC100">S.S. 2:2 As a lily among thorns, / So is my love among the daughters. </p> <p class="CC100">S.S. 2:3 As the apple tree among the trees of the wood, / So is my beloved among the sons: In his shade I delighted and sat down, / And his fruit was sweet to my taste. </p> <p class="CC100">S.S. 2:4 He brought me into the banqueting house, / And his banner over me was love. </p> <p class="CC100">S.S. 2:5 Sustain me with raisin cakes, / Refresh me with apples, / For I am sick with love. </p> <p class="CC100">S.S. 2:6 His left hand is under my head, / And his right hand embraces me. </p> <p class="CC100">S.S. 2:7 I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, / By the gazelles or by the hinds of the fields, / Not to rouse up or awaken my love / Until she pleases. </p></div> <p class="CC3" onclick="show(this)">1. Draw me is personal (1:4); the Lord said, “I drew them with cords of a man, / With bands of love” (Hosea 11:4a); this indicates that God loves us with His divine love not on the level of divinity but on the level of humanity; the cords of a man through which God draws us include Christ's incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension; it is by all these steps of Christ in His humanity that God's love in His salvation reaches us in a personal way (Rom. 5:8; 1 John 4:9-10). </p><div class="title"><p class="CC100">S.S. 1:4 Draw me; we will run after you—The king has brought me into his chambers—/ We will be glad and rejoice in you; / We will extol your love more than wine. / Rightly do they love you. </p> <p class="CC100">Hosea 11:4 I drew them with cords of a man, / With bands of love; And I was to them like those / Who lift off the yoke on their jaws; / And I gently caused them to eat. </p> <p class="CC100">Rom. 5:8 But God commends His own love to us in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. </p> <p class="CC100">1 John 4:9 In this the love of God was manifested among us, that God sent His only begotten Son into the world that we might have life and live through Him. </p> <p class="CC100">1 John 4:10 Herein is love, not that we have loved God but that He loved us and sent His Son as a propitiation for our sins. </p></div> <p class="CC3" onclick="show(this)">2. Kiss me (S. S. 1:2) is affectionate; after believing in Christ to receive Him as the divine life (John 1:4,12), we need to love Christ in a personal and affectionate way that we may pursue Him and enjoy Him as our satisfaction; Psalm 2:12 commands us to “kiss the Son”; kissing Christ is the enjoyment of Christ. </p><div class="title"><p class="CC100">S.S. 1:2 Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth! / For your love is better than wine. </p> <p class="CC100">John 1:4 In Him was life, and the life was the light of men. </p> <p class="CC100">John 1:12 But as many as received Him, to them He gave the authority to become children of God, to those who believe into His name, </p> <p class="CC100">Psa. 2:12 Kiss the Son / Lest He be angry and you perish from the way; / For His anger may suddenly be kindled. / Blessed are all those who take refuge in Him. </p></div> <p class="CC3" onclick="show(this)">3. In her pursuing of Christ the seeker is brought by Him into her regenerated spirit as the Holiest of all (his chambers—S. S. 1:4) to have fellowship with Him; His chambers indicate a private relationship with the Lord. </p><div class="title"><p class="CC100">S.S. 1:4 Draw me; we will run after you—The king has brought me into his chambers—/ We will be glad and rejoice in you; / We will extol your love more than wine. / Rightly do they love you. </p></div> <p class="CC3" onclick="show(this)">4. Furthermore, because Christ visits us in our regenerated spirit as His inner chambers, our relationship with Him must be spiritual; He visits us in our spirit privately, coming to us in a spiritual way, not in a physical way. </p> <p class="CC3" onclick="show(this)">5. All the spiritual principles are contained in this first stage of the seeker's overcoming life in Song of Songs; the lessons that follow are not new, but they are old lessons repeated in a deeper way; regeneration brings the gene of God into us, and all the experiences of our whole Christian life are in this gene—1 John 3:9. </p><div class="title"><p class="CC100">1 John 3:9 Everyone who has been begotten of God does not practice sin, because His seed abides in him; and he cannot sin, because he has been begotten of God. </p></div> <p class="CC2" onclick="show(this)">B. In the second stage of Song of Songs, the lover of Christ is called to be delivered from the self through her oneness with the cross of Christ—2:8--3:5: </p><div class="title"><p class="CC100">S.S. 2:8 The voice of my beloved! Now he comes, / Leaping upon the mountains, / Skipping upon the hills. </p> <p class="CC100">S.S. 2:9 My beloved is like a gazelle or a young hart. / Now he stands behind our wall; / He is looking through the windows, / He is glancing through the lattice. </p> <p class="CC100">S.S. 2:10 My beloved responds and says to me, / Rise up, my love, / My beauty, and come away; </p> <p class="CC100">S.S. 2:11 For now the winter is past; / The rain is over and gone. </p> <p class="CC100">S.S. 2:12 Flowers appear on the earth; / The time of singing has come, / And the voice of the turtledove is heard in our land. </p> <p class="CC100">S.S. 2:13 The fig tree has ripened its figs, / And the vines are in blossom—they give forth their fragrance. / Rise up, my love, / My beauty, and come away. </p> <p class="CC100">S.S. 2:14 My dove, in the clefts of the rock, / In the covert of the precipice, Let me see your countenance, / Let me hear your voice; / For your voice is sweet, / And your countenance is lovely. </p> <p class="CC100">S.S. 2:15 Catch the foxes for us, / The little foxes, / That ruin the vineyards / While our vineyards are in blossom. </p> <p class="CC100">S.S. 2:16 My beloved is mine, and I am his; / He pastures his flock among the lilies. </p> <p class="CC100">S.S. 2:17 Until the day dawns and the shadows flee away, / Turn, my beloved, and be like a gazelle or a young hart / On the mountains of Bether. </p> <p class="CC100">S.S. 3:1 On my bed night after night / I sought him whom my soul loves; / I sought him, but found him not. </p> <p class="CC100">S.S. 3:2 I will rise now and go about in the city; / In the streets and in the squares / I will seek him whom my soul loves. / I sought him, but found him not. </p> <p class="CC100">S.S. 3:3 The watchmen who go about in the city found me—/ Have you seen him whom my soul loves? </p> <p class="CC100">S.S. 3:4 Scarcely had I passed them / When I found him whom my soul loves; / I held him and would not let go / Until I had brought him into my mother's house / And into the chamber of her who conceived me. </p> <p class="CC100">S.S. 3:5 I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, / By the gazelles or by the hinds of the fields, / Not to rouse up or awaken my love / Until she pleases. </p></div> <p class="CC3" onclick="show(this)">1. Song of Songs 2:8-9 speaks of the vitality of resurrection; in these verses Christ is likened to a gazelle or a young hart “leaping upon the mountains, / Skipping upon the hills”; mountains and hills refer to difficulties and barriers, but nothing is too high or too great to stop the resurrected Christ; we need to seek for and know Christ's mountain-leaping and hill-skipping presence. </p><div class="title"><p class="CC100">S.S. 2:8 The voice of my beloved! Now he comes, / Leaping upon the mountains, / Skipping upon the hills. </p> <p class="CC100">S.S. 2:9 My beloved is like a gazelle or a young hart. / Now he stands behind our wall; / He is looking through the windows, / He is glancing through the lattice. </p></div> <p class="CC3" onclick="show(this)">2. The lover of Christ falls into introspection, which becomes a seclusion as a wall that keeps her away from the presence of Christ (v. 9b); hence, Christ encourages her to rise up and come out of her low situation to be with Him (v. 10). </p><div class="title"><p class="CC100">S.S. 2:9 My beloved is like a gazelle or a young hart. / Now he stands behind our wall; / He is looking through the windows, / He is glancing through the lattice. </p> <p class="CC100">S.S. 2:10 My beloved responds and says to me, / Rise up, my love, / My beauty, and come away; </p></div> <p class="CC3" onclick="show(this)">3. The lover of Christ also hears the Lord telling her that the time of dormancy (winter) is past and that the trials (rain) are over and gone (v. 11); He also tells her that the springtime has come; thus, she is entreated and encouraged by the Lord with the flourishing riches of resurrection (vv. 12-13). </p><div class="title"><p class="CC100">S.S. 2:11 For now the winter is past; / The rain is over and gone. </p> <p class="CC100">S.S. 2:12 Flowers appear on the earth; / The time of singing has come, / And the voice of the turtledove is heard in our land. </p> <p class="CC100">S.S. 2:13 The fig tree has ripened its figs, / And the vines are in blossom—they give forth their fragrance. / Rise up, my love, / My beauty, and come away. </p></div> <p class="CC3" onclick="show(this)">4. It is by the power of resurrection, not by our natural life, that we, the lovers of Christ, are enabled to be conformed to His death by being one with His cross (vv. 14-15); the reality of resurrection is the pneumatic Christ as the consummated Spirit, who indwells and is mingled with our regenerated spirit; it is in such a mingled spirit that we participate in and experience the resurrection of Christ, which enables us to be one with the cross to be delivered from the self and to be transformed into a new man in God's new creation for the fulfillment of God's economy in the building up of the organic Body of Christ (Rom. 8:2, 4, 29; Gal. 6:15; 2 Cor. 5:17). </p><div class="title"><p class="CC100">S.S. 2:14 My dove, in the clefts of the rock, / In the covert of the precipice, Let me see your countenance, / Let me hear your voice; / For your voice is sweet, / And your countenance is lovely. </p> <p class="CC100">S.S. 2:15 Catch the foxes for us, / The little foxes, / That ruin the vineyards / While our vineyards are in blossom. </p> <p class="CC100">Rom. 8:2 For the law of the Spirit of life has freed me in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and of death. </p> <p class="CC100">Rom. 8:4 That the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us, who do not walk according to the flesh but according to the spirit. </p> <p class="CC100">Rom. 8:29 Because those whom He foreknew, He also predestinated to be conformed to the image of His Son, that He might be the Firstborn among many brothers; </p> <p class="CC100">Gal. 6:15 For neither is circumcision anything nor uncircumcision, but a new creation is what matters. </p> <p class="CC100">2 Cor. 5:17 So then if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old things have passed away; behold, they have become new. </p></div> <p class="CC2" onclick="show(this)">C. In the third stage of Song of Songs, the lover of Christ is called to live in ascension as the new creation in resurrection—3:6--5:1: </p><div class="title"><p class="CC100">S.S. 3:6 Who is she who comes up from the wilderness / Like pillars of smoke, / Perfumed with myrrh and frankincense, / With all the fragrant powders of the merchant? </p> <p class="CC100">S.S. 3:7 There is Solomon's bed; / Sixty mighty men surround it, / Of the mighty men of Israel. </p> <p class="CC100">S.S. 3:8 All of them wield the sword and are expert in war; / Each man has his sword at his thigh / Because of the night alarms. </p> <p class="CC100">S.S. 3:9 King Solomon made himself a palanquin / Of the wood of Lebanon. </p> <p class="CC100">S.S. 3:10 Its posts he made of silver; / Its bottom, of gold; / Its seat, of purple; / Its midst was inlaid with love / From the daughters of Jerusalem. </p> <p class="CC100">S.S. 3:11 Go forth, O daughters of Zion, / And look at King Solomon with the crown / With which his mother crowned him / On the day of his espousals, / Yes, on the day of the gladness of his heart. </p> <p class="CC100">S.S. 4:1 Oh, you are beautiful, my love! / Oh, you are beautiful!

To live in ascension is to live continually in our spirit; when we live in our spirit, we are joined to the ascended Christ in the heavens—Eph. 2:22; Gen. 28:12-17; John 1:51; Rev. 4:1-2; Heb. 4:12, 16 and footnote 1. </p><div class="title"><p class="CC100">Eph. 2:22 In whom you also are being built together into a dwelling place of God in spirit. </p> <p class="CC100">Gen. 28:12 And he dreamed that there was a ladder set up on the earth, and its top reached to heaven; and there the angels of God were ascending and descending on it. </p> <p class="CC100">Gen. 28:13 And there was Jehovah, standing above it; and He said, I am Jehovah, the God of Abraham your father and the God of Isaac. The land on which you lie, I will give to you and to your seed. </p> <p class="CC100">Gen. 28:14 And your seed will be as the dust of the earth, and you will spread abroad to the west and to the east and to the north and to the south, and in you and in your seed will all the families of the earth be blessed. </p> <p class="CC100">Gen. 28:15 And, behold, I am with you and will keep you wherever you go and will cause you to return to this land, for I will not leave you until I have done what I have promised you. </p> <p class="CC100">Gen. 28:16 And Jacob awoke from his sleep and said, Surely Jehovah is in this place, and I did not know it. </p> <p class="CC100">Gen. 28:17 And he was afraid and said, How awesome is this place! This is none other than the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven. </p> <p class="CC100">John 1:51 And He said to him, Truly, truly, I say to you, You shall see heaven opened and the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of Man. </p> <p class="CC100">Rev. 4:1 After these things I saw, and behold, a door opened in heaven, and the first voice which I heard was like a trumpet speaking with me, saying, Come up here, and I will show you the things that must take place after these things. </p> <p class="CC100">Rev. 4:2 Immediately I was in spirit; and behold, there was a throne set in heaven, and upon the throne there was One sitting; </p> <p class="CC100">Heb. 4:12 For the word of God is living and operative and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing even to the dividing of soul and spirit and of joints and marrow, and able to discern the thoughts and intentions of the heart. </p> <p class="CC100">Heb. 4:16 Let us therefore come forward with boldness to the throne of grace that we may receive mercy and find grace for timely help. </p> <p class="CC100">Heb. 4:16 footnote 1: Undoubtedly, the throne mentioned here is the throne of God, which is in heaven (Rev. 4:2). The throne of God is the throne of authority toward all the universe (Dan. 7:9; Rev. 5:1). But toward us, the believers, it becomes the throne of grace, signified by the expiation cover (the mercy seat) within the Holy of Holies (Exo. 25:17, 21). This throne is the throne of both God and the Lamb (Rev. 22:1). How can we come to the throne of God and the Lamb, Christ, in heaven while we still live on earth? The secret is our spirit, referred to in v. 12. The very Christ who is sitting on the throne in heaven (Rom. 8:34) is also now in us (Rom. 8:10), that is, in our spirit (2 Tim. 4:22), where the habitation of God is (Eph. 2:22). At Bethel, the house of God, the habitation of God, which is the gate of heaven, Christ is the ladder that joins earth to heaven and brings heaven to earth (Gen. 28:12-17; John 1:51). Since today our spirit is the place of God's habitation, it is now the gate of heaven, where Christ is the ladder that joins us, the people on earth, to heaven, and brings heaven to us. Hence, whenever we turn to our spirit, we enter through the gate of heaven and touch the throne of grace in heaven through Christ as the heavenly ladder. </p></div> <p class="CC3" onclick="show(this)">2. “King Solomon made himself a palanquin/Of the wood of Lebanon./Its posts he made of silver,/Its bottom, of gold;/Its seat, of purple;/Its midst was inlaid with love / From the daughters of Jerusalem”—S.

Song of Songs 7:12 says, “Let us rise up early for the vineyards; / Let us see if the vine has budded, / If the blossom is open, / If the pomegranates are in bloom; / There I will give you my love”; at this time she is able to relate the Lord's work to the Lord Himself; now she can express her love to the Lord at the place of His work. </p><div class="title"><p class="CC100">S.S. 7:12 Let us rise up early for the vineyards; / Let us see if the vine has budded, / If the blossom is open, / If the pomegranates are in bloom; / There I will give you my love. </p></div> <p class="CC2" onclick="show(this)">F. In the sixth stage of Song of Songs, the lover of Christ is hoping to be raptured (8:1-14); she is coming up from the wilderness (the earthly realm) by “leaning on her beloved” (v. 5): </p><div class="title"><p class="CC100">S.S. 8:1 O that you were like a brother to me, / Who nursed at my mother's breasts! / If I found you outside, I would kiss you, / And none would despise me. </p> <p class="CC100">S.S. 8:2 I would lead you and bring you / Into my mother's house, / Who has instructed me; / I would make you drink spiced wine / From the juice of my pomegranate. </p> <p class="CC100">S.S. 8:3 His left hand would be under my head, / And his right hand would embrace me. </p> <p class="CC100">S.S. 8:4 I adjure you, O daughters of Jerusalem, / Do not rouse up or awaken my love / Until she pleases. </p> <p class="CC100">S.S. 8:5 Who is this who comes up from the wilderness, / Leaning on her beloved? / I awakened you under the apple tree: / There your mother was in labor with you; / There she was in labor and brought you forth. </p> <p class="CC100">S.S. 8:6 Set me as a seal on your heart, / As a seal on your arm; / For love is as strong as death, / Jealousy is as cruel as Sheol; / Its flashes are the flashes of fire, / A flame of Jehovah. </p> <p class="CC100">S.S. 8:7 Many waters cannot quench love, / Nor do floods drown it. / If a man gave all the substance of his house for love, / It would be utterly despised. </p> <p class="CC100">S.S. 8:8 We have a little sister, / And she has no breasts: / What shall we do for our sister / On the day when she is spoken for? </p> <p class="CC100">S.S. 8:9 If she is a wall, / We will build on her a battlement of silver; / And if she is a door, / We will enclose her with boards of cedar. </p> <p class="CC100">S.S. 8:10 I am a wall, and my breasts are like towers; / Then I was in his eyes like one who has found peace. </p> <p class="CC100">S.S. 8:11 Solomon had a vineyard at Baal-hamon: / He let out the vineyard to keepers; / Each was to bring a thousand shekels of silver for its fruit. </p> <p class="CC100">S.S. 8:12 My vineyard, which is mine, is before me. / You will have the thousand, O Solomon; / And those who keep its fruit, two hundred. </p> <p class="CC100">S.S. 8:13 O you who dwell in the gardens, / My companions listen for your voice; / Let me hear it. </p> <p class="CC100">S.S. 8:14 Make haste, my beloved, / And be like a gazelle or a young hart / Upon the mountains of spices. </p></div> <p class="CC3" onclick="show(this)">1. Leaning on her beloved implies that, like Jacob, the socket of her hip has been touched, and her natural strength has been dealt with by the Lord—Gen. 32:24-25. </p><div class="title"><p class="CC100">Gen. 32:24 And Jacob was left alone, and a man wrestled with him until the break of dawn. </p> <p class="CC100">Gen. 32:25 And when the man saw that He did not prevail against him, He touched the socket of his hip; and the socket of Jacob's hip was dislocated as he wrestled with Him. </p></div> <p class="CC3" onclick="show(this)">2. Leaning on her beloved also implies that she finds herself pressed beyond measure, and this seems to last until the wilderness journey is over—2 Cor. 1:8-9; 12:9-10; 13:3-4. </p><div class="title"><p class="CC100">2 Cor. 1:8 For we do not want you to be ignorant, brothers, of our affliction which befell us in Asia, that we were excessively burdened, beyond our power, so that we despaired even of living. </p> <p class="CC100">2 Cor. 1:9 Indeed we ourselves had the response of death in ourselves, that we should not base our confidence on ourselves but on God, who raises the dead; </p> <p class="CC100">2 Cor. 12:9 And He has said to me, My grace is sufficient for you, for My power is perfected in weakness.

She asks her Beloved to set her as a seal on His heart of love and as a seal on His arm of strength; at this point she is conscious of her powerlessness and helplessness, and she realizes that everything depends on God's love and preserving power—S. S. 8:6-7. </p><div class="title"><p class="CC100">S.S. 8:6 Set me as a seal on your heart, / As a seal on your arm; / For love is as strong as death, / Jealousy is as cruel as Sheol; / Its flashes are the flashes of fire, / A flame of Jehovah. </p> <p class="CC100">S.S. 8:7 Many waters cannot quench love, / Nor do floods drown it. / If a man gave all the substance of his house for love, / It would be utterly despised. </p></div> <p class="CC3" onclick="show(this)">4.

Our lives depend on the Lord's words, and our work depends on the Lord's commands; the central point of our prayers should be our longing for the Lord's speaking—Rev. 2:7; 1 Sam. 3:9-10; cf.

Without the Lord's words, we will not have any revelation, light, or subjective knowledge of Christ as the mystery of God and of the church as the mystery of Christ (Col. 2:2; Eph. 3:4-5; 5:32); the life of the believers hinges totally upon the Lord's speaking (vv. 26-27). </p><div class="title"><p class="CC100">Col. 2:2 That their hearts may be comforted, they being knit together in love and unto all the riches of the full assurance of understanding, unto the full knowledge of the mystery of God, Christ, </p> <p class="CC100">Eph. 3:4 By which, in reading it, you can perceive my understanding in the mystery of Christ, </p> <p class="CC100">Eph. 3:5 Which in other generations was not made known to the sons of men, as it has now been revealed to His holy apostles and prophets in spirit, </p> <p class="CC100">Eph. 5:32 This mystery is great, but I speak with regard to Christ and the church. </p> <p class="CC100">Eph. 5:26 That He might sanctify her, cleansing her by the washing of the water in the word, </p> <p class="CC100">Eph. 5:27 That He might present the church to Himself glorious, not having spot or wrinkle or any such things, but that she would be holy and without blemish. </p></div> <p class="CC1" onclick="show(this)">II. As the concluding word of this poetic book, the lover of Christ prays that her Beloved would make haste to come back in the power of His resurrection (gazelle and young hart) to set up His sweet and beautiful kingdom (mountains of spices), which will fill the whole earth—S. S. 8:14; Rev. 11:15; Dan. 2:35: </p><div class="title"><p class="CC100">S.S. 8:14 Make haste, my beloved, / And be like a gazelle or a young hart / Upon the mountains of spices. </p> <p class="CC100">Rev. 11:15 And the seventh angel trumpeted; and there were loud voices in heaven, saying, The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ, and He will reign forever and ever. </p> <p class="CC100">Dan. 2:35 Then the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver, and the gold were crushed all at once, and they became like chaff from the summer threshing floors; and the wind carried them away so that no trace of them was found.

Such a prayer portrays the union and communion between Christ as the Bridegroom and His lovers as the bride in their bridal love, in the way that the prayer of John, a lover of Christ, as the concluding word of the Holy Scriptures, reveals God's eternal economy concerning Christ and the church in His divine love—Rev. 22:20. </p><div class="title"><p class="CC100">Rev. 22:20 He who testifies these things says, Yes, I come quickly.
