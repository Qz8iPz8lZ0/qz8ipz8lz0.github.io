        aspects: the first aspect is the work of the ministry to build up the Body of Christ, and the second aspect is
        our spiritual life, which comprises many spiritual experiences that enable us to live a life that matches the
        church life: </p>
    <p class="CC2" onclick="show(this)">A. We need to love the Lord in incorruptibility by doing the work of the
        ministry to build up the Body of Christ: </p>
