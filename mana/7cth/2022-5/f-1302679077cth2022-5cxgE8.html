    <div class="title">
        <p class="CC100">Rev. 3:7 And to the messenger of the church in Philadelphia write: These things says the Holy
            One, the true One, the One who has the key of David, the One who opens and no one will shut, and shuts and
            no one opens: </p>
        <p class="CC100">Rev. 3:8 I know your works; behold, I have put before you an opened door which no one can shut,
            because you have a little power and have kept My word and have not denied My name. </p>
        <p class="CC100">Rev. 3:9 Behold, I will make those of the synagogue of Satan, those who call themselves Jews
            and are not, but lie-behold, I will cause them to come and fall prostrate before your feet and to know that
            I have loved you. </p>
        <p class="CC100">Rev. 3:10 Because you have kept the word of My endurance, I also will keep you out of the hour
            of trial, which is about to come on the whole inhabited earth, to try them who dwell on the earth. </p>
        <p class="CC100">Rev. 3:11 I come quickly; hold fast what you have that no one take your crown. </p>
        <p class="CC100">Rev. 3:12 He who overcomes, him I will make a pillar in the temple of My God, and he shall by
            no means go out anymore, and I will write upon him the name of My God and the name of the city of My God,
            the New Jerusalem, which descends out of heaven from My God, and My new name. </p>
        <p class="CC100">Rev. 3:13 He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. </p>
        <p class="CC100">Rev. 3:14 And to the messenger of the church in Laodicea write: These things says the Amen, the
            faithful and true Witness, the beginning of the creation of God: </p>
        <p class="CC100">Rev. 3:15 I know your works, that you are neither cold nor hot; I wish that you were cold or
            hot. </p>
        <p class="CC100">Rev. 3:16 So, because you are lukewarm and neither hot nor cold, I am about to spew you out of
            My mouth. </p>
        <p class="CC100">Rev. 3:17 Because you say, I am wealthy and have become rich and have need of nothing, and do
            not know that you are wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked, </p>
        <p class="CC100">Rev. 3:18 I counsel you to buy from Me gold refined by fire that you may be rich, and white
            garments that you may be clothed and that the shame of your nakedness may not be manifested, and eyesalve to
            anoint your eyes that you may see. </p>
        <p class="CC100">Rev. 3:19 As many as I love I rebuke and discipline; be zealous therefore and repent. </p>
        <p class="CC100">Rev. 3:20 Behold, I stand at the door and knock; if anyone hears My voice and opens the door,
            then I will come in to him and dine with him and he with Me. </p>
        <p class="CC100">Rev. 3:21 He who overcomes, to him I will give to sit with Me on My throne, as I also overcame
            and sat with My Father on His throne. </p>
        <p class="CC100">Rev. 3:22 He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. </p>

    <p class="CC1" onclick="show(this)">I. We need to see, live, and practice “the present truth,” the “up-to-date”
        truth, in order to change the age and bring Christ back; we need to hear what the Spirit is speaking to the
        churches, the voice of God in the present hour—2 Pet. 1:12; Rev. 2:7; Matt. 16:18; Gen. 2:22; Eph. 5:25-27; cf.
        John 1:23; S. S. 8:13-14: </p>

        <p class="CC100">Matt. 16:18 And I also say to you that you are Peter, and upon this rock I will build My

        unfaithfulness, negligence, disobedience, and degradation, many truths were lost and hidden from man—cf. 2 Kings
        22:8-11; 23:24-25. </p>
    <div class="title">
        <p class="CC100">2 Kings 22:8 Then Hilkiah the high priest said to Shaphan the scribe, I have found the book of

        <p class="CC100">2 Kings 22:9 And Shaphan the scribe came to the king and brought back word to the king and
            said, Your servants have emptied out the money which was found in the house and have delivered it into the

        <p class="CC100">2 Kings 22:10 And Shaphan the scribe reported to the king, saying, Hilkiah the priest has given
            me a book. And Shaphan read it aloud before the king. </p>
        <p class="CC100">2 Kings 22:11 And when the king heard the words of the book of the law, he tore his clothes.
        </p>
        <p class="CC100">2 Kings 23:24 And moreover Josiah utterly removed the mediums and the soothsayers and the
            teraphim and the idols and all the detestable things that were seen in the land of Judah and in Jerusalem,
            that he might confirm the words of the law which were written in the book that Hilkiah the priest found in
            the house of Jehovah. </p>

        man's new discoveries; every worker of the Lord should inquire before God as to what the present truth is—Eph.
        1:17; Ezek. 1:1-3; Rev. 1:10; 21:10. </p>
    <div class="title">

            land of the Chaldeans by the river Chebar; and the hand of Jehovah was upon him there. </p>

        we see today are the cumulative revelations of God; today we are living in the tide of God's will, which is a
        continuation of all the past works of God in the previous ages; may God be gracious to us so that we do not
        become castaways of “the present truth”—1 Cor. 9:27; cf. 2 Cor. 3:3, 6, 8-9; 5:18-21. </p>

            inscribed not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tablets of stone but in tablets of
            hearts of flesh. </p>
        <p class="CC100">2 Cor. 3:6 Who has also made us sufficient as ministers of a new covenant, ministers not of the

        <p class="CC100">2 Cor. 3:8 How shall the ministry of the Spirit not be more in glory? </p>
        <p class="CC100">2 Cor. 3:9 For if there is glory with the ministry of condemnation, much more the ministry of
            righteousness abounds with glory. </p>
        <p class="CC100">2 Cor. 5:18 But all things are out from God, who has reconciled us to Himself through Christ
            and has given to us the ministry of reconciliation; </p>
        <p class="CC100">2 Cor. 5:19 Namely, that God in Christ was reconciling the world to Himself, not accounting
            their offenses to them, and has put in us the word of reconciliation. </p>

        church, the church of brotherly love, signified by the church in Philadelphia, can fulfill God's eternal purpose

        aspiration to arrive at the highest peak of the divine revelation of God's economy—this highest peak is God
