We should never hunt to be the first in any work for the Lord (3 John 9); rivalry in the Lord's work is not only a sign of ambition but also a sign of pride; referring to our capacity, success, perfection, and virtue is a careless form of pride (Luke 17:10; Phil. 1:15; Gal. 5:25-26). </p><div class="title"><p class="CC100">3 John 9 I wrote something to the church; but Diotrephes, who loves to be first among them, does not receive us. </p> <p class="CC100">Luke 17:10 So also you, when you do all the things which are ordered you, say, We are unprofitable slaves; we have done what we ought to have done. </p> <p class="CC100">Phil. 1:15 Some preach Christ even because of envy and strife, and some also because of good will, </p> <p class="CC100">Gal. 5:25 If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit. </p> <p class="CC100">Gal. 5:26 Let us not become vainglorious, provoking one another, envying one another. </p></div> <p class="CC3" onclick="show(this)">4.

John 21, a chapter on shepherding, is the completion and consummation of the Gospel of John; after His resurrection the Lord shepherded Peter and commissioned him to feed His lambs and shepherd His sheep; this is to incorporate the apostolic ministry with Christ's heavenly ministry to take care of God's flock, the church, which issues in the Body of Christ—vv. 15-17: </p><div class="title"><p class="CC100">John 21:1 After these things Jesus manifested Himself again to the disciples at the Sea of Tiberias. And He manifested Himself in this way: </p> <p class="CC100">John 21:2 Simon Peter and Thomas, called Didymus, and Nathanael from Cana of Galilee and the sons of Zebedee and two others of His disciples were there together. </p> <p class="CC100">John 21:3 Simon Peter said to them, I am going fishing. They said to him, We also are coming with you. They went forth and got into the boat, and that night they caught nothing. </p> <p class="CC100">John 21:4 Now as soon as the morning broke, Jesus stood on the shore; however the disciples did not know that it was Jesus. </p> <p class="CC100">John 21:5 Then Jesus said to them, Little children, you do not have any fish to eat, do you? They answered Him, No. </p> <p class="CC100">John 21:6 And He said to them, Cast the net on the right side of the boat, and you will find some. They cast therefore, and they were no longer able to haul it in because of the abundance of fish. </p> <p class="CC100">John 21:7 Then that disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, It is the Lord! Therefore when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he put his outer garment around himself, for he was naked; and he threw himself into the sea. </p> <p class="CC100">John 21:8 But the other disciples came in the little boat, for they were not far from the land, but about two hundred cubits away, dragging the net of fish. </p> <p class="CC100">John 21:9 Then when they got out onto the land, they saw a fire of coals laid there, and fish lying on it and bread. </p> <p class="CC100">John 21:10 Jesus said to them, Bring some of the fish that you have just now caught. </p> <p class="CC100">John 21:11 Simon Peter therefore went up and hauled the net to the land full of large fish, a hundred and fifty-three; and though there were so many, the net was not torn. </p> <p class="CC100">John 21:12 Jesus said to them, Come and have breakfast. But none of the disciples dared to inquire of Him, Who are you? knowing that it was the Lord. </p> <p class="CC100">John 21:13 Jesus came and took the bread and gave it to them, and the fish likewise. </p> <p class="CC100">John 21:14 This was now the third time that Jesus was manifested to the disciples after He had been raised from the dead. </p> <p class="CC100">John 21:15 Then when they had eaten breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, Simon, son of John, do you love Me more than these? He said to Him, Yes, Lord, You know that I love You. He said to him, Feed My lambs. </p> <p class="CC100">John 21:16 He said to him again a second time, Simon, son of John, do you love Me? He said to Him, Yes, Lord, You know that I love You. He said to him, Shepherd My sheep. </p> <p class="CC100">John 21:17 He said to him the third time, Simon, son of John, do you love Me? Peter was grieved that He said to him the third time, Do you love Me? And he said to Him, Lord, You know all things; You know that I love You. Jesus said to him, Feed My sheep. </p> <p class="CC100">John 21:18 Truly, truly, I say to you, When you were younger, you girded yourself and walked where you wished; but when you grow old, you will stretch out your hands, and another will gird you and carry you where you do not wish to go. </p> <p class="CC100">John 21:19 Now this He said, signifying by what kind of death he would glorify God. And when He had said this, He said to him, Follow Me. </p> <p class="CC100">John 21:20 Peter, turning around, saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following, who also reclined on His breast at the supper and said, Lord, who is the one betraying You? </p> <p class="CC100">John 21:21 Peter therefore, seeing him, said to Jesus, Lord, and what about this man? </p> <p class="CC100">John 21:22 Jesus said to him, If I want him to remain until I come, what is that to you? You follow Me. </p> <p class="CC100">John 21:23 This word therefore went out among the brothers, that that disciple would not die, yet Jesus did not say to him that he would not die, but, If I want him to remain until I </p> <p class="CC100">come, what is that to you? </p> <p class="CC100">John 21:24 This is the disciple who testifies concerning these things, and the one who has written these things; and we know that his testimony is true. </p> <p class="CC100">John 21:25 And there are also many other things which Jesus did, which, if they were written one by one, I suppose that not even the world itself could contain the books written. </p></div> <p class="CC2" onclick="show(this)">A.
