At the end of Matthew 5, to conclude an exceedingly high section of the constitution of the kingdom of the heavens (vv. 17-48), the Lord Jesus said, “You therefore shall be perfect as your heavenly Father is perfect” (v. 48): </p><div class="title"><p class="CC100">Matt. 5:1 And when He saw the crowds, He went up to the mountain. And after He sat down, His disciples came to Him. </p> <p class="CC100">Matt. 5:2 And opening His mouth, He taught them, saying, </p> <p class="CC100">Matt. 5:3 Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of the heavens. </p> <p class="CC100">Matt. 5:4 Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted. </p> <p class="CC100">Matt. 5:5 Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth. </p> <p class="CC100">Matt. 5:6 Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be satisfied. </p> <p class="CC100">Matt. 5:7 Blessed are the merciful, for they shall be shown mercy. </p> <p class="CC100">Matt. 5:8 Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God. </p> <p class="CC100">Matt. 5:9 Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called the sons of God. </p> <p class="CC100">Matt. 5:10 Blessed are those who are persecuted for the sake of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of the heavens. </p> <p class="CC100">Matt. 5:11 Blessed are you when they reproach and persecute you, and while speaking lies, say every evil thing against you because of Me. </p> <p class="CC100">Matt. 5:12 Rejoice and exult, for your reward is great in the heavens; for so they persecuted the prophets who were before you. </p> <p class="CC100">Matt. 5:13 You are the salt of the earth. But if the salt has become tasteless, with what shall it be salted? It is no longer good for anything except to be cast out and trampled underfoot by men. </p> <p class="CC100">Matt. 5:14 You are the light of the world. It is impossible for a city situated upon a mountain to be hidden. </p> <p class="CC100">Matt. 5:15 Nor do men light a lamp and place it under the bushel, but on the lampstand; and it shines to all who are in the house. </p> <p class="CC100">Matt. 5:16 In the same way, let your light shine before men, so that they may see your good works and glorify your Father who is in the heavens. </p> <p class="CC100">Matt. 5:17 Do not think that I have come to abolish the law or the prophets; I have not come to abolish, but to fulfill. </p> <p class="CC100">Matt. 5:18 For truly I say to you, Until heaven and earth pass away, one iota or one serif shall by no means pass away from the law until all come to pass. </p> <p class="CC100">Matt. 5:19 Therefore whoever annuls one of the least of these commandments, and teaches men so, shall be called the least in the kingdom of the heavens; but whoever practices and teaches them, he shall be called great in the kingdom of the heavens. </p> <p class="CC100">Matt. 5:20 For I say to you that unless your righteousness surpasses that of the scribes and Pharisees, you shall by no means enter into the kingdom of the heavens. </p> <p class="CC100">Matt. 5:21 You have heard that it was said to the ancients, "You shall not murder, and whoever murders shall be liable to the judgment." </p> <p class="CC100">Matt. 5:22 But I say to you that everyone who is angry with his brother shall be liable to the judgment. And whoever says to his brother, Raca, shall be liable to the judgment of the Sanhedrin; and whoever says, Moreh, shall be liable to the Gehenna of fire. </p> <p class="CC100">Matt. 5:23 Therefore if you are offering your gift at the altar and there you remember that your brother has something against you, </p> <p class="CC100">Matt. 5:24 Leave your gift there before the altar, and first go and be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift. </p> <p class="CC100">Matt. 5:25 Be well disposed quickly toward your opponent at law, while you are with him on the way, lest the opponent deliver you to the judge, and the judge to the officer, and you be thrown into prison. </p> <p class="CC100">Matt. 5:26 Truly I say to you, You shall by no means come out from there until you pay the last quadrans. </p> <p class="CC100">Matt. 5:27 You have heard that it was said, "You shall not commit adultery." </p> <p class="CC100">Matt. 5:28 But I say to you that everyone who looks at a woman in order to lust after her has already committed adultery with her in his heart. </p> <p class="CC100">Matt. 5:29 So if your right eye stumbles you, pluck it out and cast it from you; for it is more profitable for you that one of your members perish than for your whole body to be cast into Gehenna. </p> <p class="CC100">Matt. 5:30 And if your right hand stumbles you, cut it off and cast it from you, for it is more profitable for you that one of your members perish than for your whole body to pass away into Gehenna. </p> <p class="CC100">Matt. 5:31 And it was said, Whoever divorces his wife, let him give her a certificate of divorce. </p> <p class="CC100">Matt. 5:32 But I say to you that everyone who divorces his wife, except for the cause of fornication, causes her to commit adultery, and whoever marries her who has been divorced commits adultery. </p> <p class="CC100">Matt. 5:33 Again, you have heard that it was said to the ancients, "You shall not break an oath, but you shall render to the Lord your oaths." </p> <p class="CC100">Matt. 5:34 But I tell you not to swear at all; neither by heaven, because it is the throne of God; </p> <p class="CC100">Matt. 5:35 Nor by the earth, because it is the footstool of His feet; nor unto Jerusalem, because it is the city of the great King; </p> <p class="CC100">Matt. 5:36 Neither shall you swear by your head, because you cannot make one hair white or black. </p> <p class="CC100">Matt. 5:37 But let your word be, Yes, yes; No, no; for anything more than these is of the evil one. </p> <p class="CC100">Matt. 5:38 You have heard that it was said, "An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth." </p> <p class="CC100">Matt. 5:39 But I tell you not to resist him who is evil; rather whoever slaps you on your right cheek, turn to him the other also. </p> <p class="CC100">Matt. 5:40 And to him who wishes to sue you and take your tunic, yield to him your cloak also; </p> <p class="CC100">Matt. 5:41 And whoever compels you to go one mile, go with him two. </p> <p class="CC100">Matt. 5:42 To him who asks of you, give; and from him who wants to borrow from you, do not turn away. </p> <p class="CC100">Matt. 5:43 You have heard that it was said, "You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy." </p> <p class="CC100">Matt. 5:44 But I say to you, Love your enemies, and pray for those who persecute you, </p> <p class="CC100">Matt. 5:45 So that you may become sons of your Father who is in the heavens, because He causes His sun to rise on the evil and the good and sends rain on the just and the unjust. </p> <p class="CC100">Matt. 5:46 For if you love those who love you, what reward do you have? Do not even the tax collectors do the same? </p> <p class="CC100">Matt. 5:47 And if you greet only your brothers, what better thing are you doing? Do not even the Gentiles do the same? </p> <p class="CC100">Matt. 5:48 You therefore shall be perfect as your heavenly Father is perfect. </p></div> <p class="CC2" onclick="show(this)">A. The kingdom people, the audience for the Lord's decree of the constitution of the kingdom of the heavens, are the regenerated believers of the New Testament, as the title sons of your Father in verse 45 indicates: </p><div class="title"><p class="CC100">Matt. 5:45 So that you may become sons of your Father who is in the heavens, because He causes His sun to rise on the evil and the good and sends rain on the just and the unjust. </p></div> <p class="CC3" onclick="show(this)">1.

Hence, they can be perfect as their heavenly Father is. </p> <p class="CC2" onclick="show(this)">B. The demand of the new law of the kingdom is much higher than the requirement of the law of the old dispensation (v. 22, footnote 2); this higher demand can be met only by the Father's divine life, not by the natural life: </p><div class="title"><p class="CC100">Matt. 5:22 footnote 2: The law of the old dispensation deals with the act of murder (v. 21), but the new law of the kingdom deals with anger, the motive of murder. Hence, the demand of the new law of the kingdom is deeper than the requirement of the law of the old dispensation. To meet the demand of the new law of the kingdom, the higher life of the new creation is needed. </p></div> <p class="CC3" onclick="show(this)">1. The kingdom of the heavens is the highest demand, and the divine life of the Father is the highest supply to meet that demand. </p> <p class="CC3" onclick="show(this)">2. The demand of the new law of the kingdom is actually the expression of the new life, the divine life, which is within the regenerated kingdom people; this demand opens up the inner being of the regenerated people, showing them that they are able to attain to such a high level and to have such a high living. </p> <p class="CC3" onclick="show(this)">3. We become God's regenerated children by the coming of the Spirit of God into our spirit to regenerate us (Rom. 8:16; John 3:6) and to make our spirit the dwelling place of God (Eph. 2:22); if we walk according to our regenerated human spirit indwelt by and mingled with the divine Spirit (1 Cor. 6:17), we are living by God's life to fulfill the righteous requirement of the law (Rom. 8:4). </p><div class="title"><p class="CC100">Rom. 8:16 The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit that we are children of God. </p> <p class="CC100">John 3:6 That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. </p> <p class="CC100">Eph. 2:22 In whom you also are being built together into a dwelling place of God in spirit. </p> <p class="CC100">1 Cor. 6:17 But he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit. </p> <p class="CC100">Rom. 8:4 That the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us, who do not walk according to the flesh but according to the spirit. </p></div> <p class="CC2" onclick="show(this)">C. For the kingdom people to be perfect as their heavenly Father is perfect means that they are perfect in His love (Matt. 5:44-45); love is the nature of God's essence (1 John 4:8, 16): </p><div class="title"><p class="CC100">Matt. 5:44 But I say to you, Love your enemies, and pray for those who persecute you, </p> <p class="CC100">Matt. 5:45 So that you may become sons of your Father who is in the heavens, because He causes His sun to rise on the evil and the good and sends rain on the just and the unjust. </p> <p class="CC100">1 John 4:8 He who does not love has not known God, because God is love. </p> <p class="CC100">1 John 4:16 And we know and have believed the love which God has in us.

Through the precious and exceedingly great promises given by God, we, the believers in Christ, have become partakers of His divine nature (2 Pet. 1:4) in an organic union with Him (John 3:15; Gal. 3:27; Matt. 28:19). </p><div class="title"><p class="CC100">John 3:15 That everyone who believes into Him may have eternal life. </p> <p class="CC100">Gal. 3:27 For as many as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ. </p> <p class="CC100">Matt. 28:19 Go therefore and disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, </p> <p class="CC100">2 Pet. 1:4 Through which He has granted to us precious and exceedingly great promises that through these you might become partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption which is in the world by lust. </p></div> <p class="CC3" onclick="show(this)">2. To partake of the divine nature is to enjoy what God is. </p> <p class="CC3" onclick="show(this)">3. The virtue of this divine nature carries us into God's glory (2 Pet. 1:3), into the full expression of the Triune God; we receive the divine life by believing, and we continually enjoy the divine nature, which is the substance of the divine life; the more we enjoy the divine nature, the more we have His virtue, and the more we are brought into His glory. </p><div class="title"><p class="CC100">2 Pet. 1:3 Seeing that His divine power has granted to us all things which relate to life and godliness, through the full knowledge of Him who has called us by His own glory and virtue, </p></div> <p class="CC3" onclick="show(this)">4.

To be perfect is to have God added to us, as seen in God's word to Abraham in Genesis 17:1—“I am the All-sufficient God; / Walk before Me, and be perfect”: </p><div class="title"><p class="CC100">Gen. 17:1 And when Abram was ninety-nine years old, Jehovah appeared to Abram and said to him, I am the All-sufficient God; / Walk before Me, and be perfect. </p></div> <p class="CC3" onclick="show(this)">1. The divine title All-sufficient God (El Shaddai in Hebrew) reveals God as the source of grace to supply His called ones with the riches of His divine being for the fulfillment of His purpose; the Lord's grace being sufficient for us is the Lord's power being perfected in our weakness (2 Cor. 12:9; Phil. 4:13; John 15:5b). </p><div class="title"><p class="CC100">2 Cor. 12:9 And He has said to me, My grace is sufficient for you, for My power is perfected in weakness.

He who abides in Me and I in him, he bears much fruit; for apart from Me you can do nothing. </p></div> <p class="CC3" onclick="show(this)">2. To walk before God is to walk in His presence, constantly enjoying Him and His all-sufficient supply. </p> <p class="CC3" onclick="show(this)">3.

When an oyster is wounded by a grain of sand, it secretes its life-juice around the grain of sand and makes it into a precious pearl. This depicts Christ as the living One coming into the death waters, being wounded by us, and secreting His life over us to make us into precious pearls for the building of God's eternal expression. That the twelve gates of the holy city are twelve pearls signifies that regeneration through the death-overcoming and life-secreting Christ is the entrance into the city. This meets the requirement of the law, which is represented by Israel and is under the observing of the guarding angels (v. 12). </p></div> <p class="CC3" onclick="show(this)">3.

And the street of the city was pure gold, like transparent glass. </p> <p class="CC100">Rev. 21:21 footnote 1, second paragraph: The New Jerusalem is built of three kinds of precious materials, signifying that she is built with the Triune God. First, the city proper, with its street, is of pure gold (vv. 18, 21). Gold, the symbol of the divine nature of God, signifies the Father as the source, from whom the element for the substantial existence of the city is produced. Second, the twelve gates of the city are pearls, which signify the Son's overcoming death and life-imparting resurrection, through which entrance to the city is gained. Third, the wall of the city and its foundation are built of precious stones, signifying the Spirit's work of transforming the redeemed and regenerated saints into precious stones for the building of God's eternal habitation that they may express God corporately in His all-permeating glory. In the garden of Eden these three kinds of treasures merely existed as materials (Gen. 2:11-12), whereas in the city of New Jerusalem these precious materials become a builded city for the fulfillment of God's eternal purpose, which is to have a corporate expression. </p></div> <p class="CC2" onclick="show(this)">B.
