<p class="AA3">“生命树预表将生命分赐给人，叫人喜悦满足的基督。”（创世记生命读经，一七五页）</p>
<p style="color:#808080;">
"The tree of life typifies Christ who imparts life to man and who pleases and satisfies man"—Life-study of Genesis, p. 141.</p>
<p class="AA3">“我们唯一所需要的，乃是享受主作生命树。”（生命树，二一页）</p>
<p style="color:#808080;">
"The one thing we need is to enjoy the Lord as the tree of life"—The Tree of Life, p. 23.</p>
<p class="AA3">“一九四三年五月我……患了严重的肺病。……生命树的信息……是我在病中二年半所看见的。在那二年半里，我只看见一件事，就是我们在主的恢复里，在祂的工作里，所缺的就是生命。无论难处是在哪一面，都是由于缺少生命。为着这点，我非常懊悔，在主面前有许多的认罪，和彻底的悔改，并在祂面前有对付。……‘生命树’的信息在南京救了许多人，也释放了许多人；这些人都是我们中间的弟兄姊妹。他们因着四年前上海召会的风波，多年瘪气下沉，什么都不能作，这样的信息，叫他们的灵得着了释放，心也得着开启。……感谢主，借着生命树的信息，也使上海召会得着了医治。……乃是这个生命树的信息，立定了一个基础，使上海召会得着复兴。”（历史与启示上册，一五六、一六〇至一六一、一六三、一六六至一六七页）</p>
<p style="color:#808080;">
"In May of 1943…I had contracted a serious case of tuberculosis…I saw the tree of life during the two and a half years of my illness. During those two and a half years I saw that in the Lord's recovery and in His work we lacked life. Every kind of problem, regardless of what it may be, is the result of a shortage of life. When I saw this, I was extremely remorseful, I confessed much and had a thorough repentance before the Lord, and I also had many dealings before Him…The messages on the tree of life saved many saints and also released many of the brothers and sisters in Nanking. Because of the four years of turmoil in the church in Shanghai, the saints had been disheartened and depressed for years and were unable to do anything. These messages released their spirit and enlightened their heart…I thank the Lord that through the messages on the tree of life, the church in Shanghai was healed…The messages on the tree of life laid a foundation for the revival of the church in Shanghai"—The History and Revelation of the Lord's Recovery, vol. 1, pp. 130, 133, 135, 138.</p>
<p class="AA3">“吃生命树，就是享受基督作我们生命的供应，该是召会生活中首要的事。”（圣经恢复本，启二7注6，第四段）</p>
<p style="color:#808080;">
"Eating the tree of life, that is, enjoying Christ as our life supply, should be the primary matter in the church life"—Rev. 2:7, footnote 6, para. 4.</p>
<p class="AA3">“恶人的邪恶光景，乃是他们没有就近主来吃主并享受主。……他们作许多事，却不来接触主，取用祂，接受祂，尝祂并享受祂。在神眼中，没有比这更邪恶的事。”（圣经恢复本，赛五七20注1）</p>
<p style="color:#808080;">
"The evil condition of the wicked is that they do not come to the Lord to eat and enjoy the Lord…They do many things, but they do not come to contact the Lord, to take Him, to receive Him, to taste Him, and to enjoy Him. In the sight of God, nothing is more evil than this"—Isa. 57:20, footnote 1.</p>
<p class="AA3">“神的心意是要把祂自己〔作为生命树〕给人享受。……我们若有这两点〔即神要我们享受祂，以及神不要我们为祂作什么〕的异象，我们就要看见，基督徒在神面前的故事，完全就是这个享受的故事。……我们需要对以上两点有清楚的看见，……只要这个观念一转了，看清楚了，要实际地过一种享受神的生活，就是一件容易的事。”（生命树与善恶树的异象，七〇、七三至七四页）</p>
<p style="color:#808080;">
God's intention for man was to give Himself as the tree of life to man for man to enjoy. "To see that God wants us to enjoy Him and that He does not want us to do anything for Him is to see that the Christian life is a matter of enjoyment…If our concept is changed so that we see these two points, it will be easy for us to live a life of enjoying God"—The Vision of the Tree of Life and the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil, p. 60.</p>
<p class="AA3">“我们若要实际地走上享受神的路，就得厉害地转一个观念。……我们若要进入享受神的实际，非得对这件事有厉害的看见不可。……直到将近四十岁时，我才蒙了主的眷顾，懂得这条享受神的路。因此，我非常懊丧，自己有二十年之久，大多的时间和力量都白白消耗了。那许多的祷告、读经，以及所读的属灵书报，几乎都没有什么价值。我才看见，我们从前不光是作工的路错了，连属灵追求的路也错了。……我自己既走过那条错路，吃过大亏，就不愿意你们再重蹈覆辙；并且盼望你们能走上这条享受神的路。我要郑重地说，你们不该再走那条错路，乃要看见已往那种追求有问题。我们必须在观念上有个彻底的转变；换句话说，我们需要有一个非常厉害的异象，一个非常厉害的看见。”（生命树与善恶树的异象，六〇至六一页）</p>
<p style="color:#808080;">
"If we want to take the way of enjoying God, we must have a change of concept…If we want to enter into the reality of the enjoyment of God, we must see a controlling vision…It was not until I was forty years of age that the Lord revealed to me the way of enjoying Him. I was disappointed that for twenty years most of my time and energy had been wasted. Most of my prayers were of no value, and the time that I had spent reading the Bible and other spiritual books was also of no value. This is when I realized that our way of working was wrong and that our way of spiritual pursuit was also wrong…Because I suffered a great loss from taking the wrong way, I do not want others to repeat the same mistake. I hope that others can take the way of enjoying God. I implore the saints to no longer take the wrong way. We should consider our former way of pursuit. We must have a drastic change of concept. We need to have a controlling vision"—The Vision of the Tree of Life and the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil, p. 51.</p>
